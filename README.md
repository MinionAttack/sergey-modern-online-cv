My online Curriculum Vitae website. A simple static web with HTML5 + CSS3 + JavaScript.

This new repository has been made to allow for more modular development as content is updated, rather than having a
single gigantic HTML
file that became increasingly large and unmanageable.

Because HTML does not natively support splitting into multiple files, this new version of the repository uses
the [sergey](https://sergey.cool/) tool to generate the HTML file, as it allows splitting HTML files into multiple files
and allows HTML
content to be organised in a more modular way.

On the visual aspect, I have modified the `Personal - Free Portfolio Bootstrap Template`
from [BootstrapMade](https://bootstrapmade.com/personal-free-resume-bootstrap-template/).

# Usage
